                <h3>How can you design a page layout with Flexbox in mind? <h3>
                <p>To design a fully responsive webpage using Flexbox, you start by structuring your HTML with meaningful sections—like a header, navigation, main content area, sidebar (if needed), and footer. In your CSS, set the main container to `display: flex` to activate Flexbox. Use `flex-direction` to control the layout flow—`row` for horizontal layouts or `column` for vertical stacking. For responsive design, combine Flexbox with media queries to adjust layouts based on screen size. For example, on larger screens you might use `flex-direction: row` to place content and sidebar side by side, but switch to `column` on smaller devices for vertical stacking. Use `flex-wrap: wrap` to ensure content doesn’t overflow, and apply `justify-content` and `align-items` to control spacing and alignment. Flexbox’s ability to distribute space and resize items dynamically makes it ideal for building layouts that adapt smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
