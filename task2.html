                <h3>How can you horizontally and vertically align elements using Flexbox?<h3>
                <p>Flexbox lets you easily align elements horizontally and vertically by using two main properties. The `justify-content` property aligns items along the main axis (usually horizontally), letting you position them at the start, center, or end of the container. The `align-items` property aligns items along the cross axis (usually vertically), allowing you to center or stretch them within the container. By combining these properties, you can quickly center elements both horizontally and vertically inside a flex container.</p>
