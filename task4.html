                <h3>What are the key properties that work on flex containers and flex items?<h3>
                <p>In Flexbox, certain properties are designed specifically for flex containers, while others apply to flex items within those containers. For flex containers, three key properties are `display`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`. The `display` property must be set to `flex` or `inline-flex` to activate Flexbox behavior. `Justify-content` controls the alignment of items along the main axis, allowing you to space them evenly or align them to the start, center, or end. `Align-items` aligns items along the cross axis, determining how flex items are stretched or centered vertically (or horizontally, depending on flex direction). For flex items, useful properties include `order`, `flex-grow`, and `align-self`. `Order` lets you rearrange the visual order of items regardless of their HTML order. `Flex-grow` defines how much a flex item should grow relative to the others when extra space is available. `Align-self` allows an individual item to override the containerâ€™s `align-items` setting and align itself independently along the cross axis.</p>
