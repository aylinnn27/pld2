                <h3>What are the shorthand properties for flex in CSS? <h3>
                <p>The `flex` shorthand property in CSS is used to define how a flex item grows, shrinks, and what its base size should be. It combines three properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. The syntax is typically written as `flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]`. For example, `flex: 1 0 100px` means the item can grow to take up extra space (`1`), won't shrink (`0`), and starts with a base width of `100px`. You can also use simplified values like `flex: 1`, which is the same as `flex: 1 1 0%`, or `flex: auto`, which sets the item to grow and shrink as needed based on its content. Using the shorthand helps keep the code clean and efficient when styling flex items.</p>
