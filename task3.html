                <h3>What is the difference between the main axis and the cross axis in Flexbox?<h3>
                <p>In Flexbox, the main axis is the direction along which flex items are laid out, and the cross axis is perpendicular to it. By default, with `flex-direction: row`, the main axis runs horizontally and the cross axis runs vertically. When `flex-direction` is set to `column`, the main axis becomes vertical, and the cross axis becomes horizontal. This affects alignment properties like `justify-content`, which aligns items along the main axis, and `align-items`, which aligns them along the cross axis.</p>
