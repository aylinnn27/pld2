                    Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses everything from creating simple static web pages to complex dynamic platforms and online services. Web development is typically divided into two main areas: front-end development, which focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and back-end development, which involves server-side programming, databases, and APIs to handle data and functionality behind the scenes. Full-stack developers work on both ends of a web application.

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p><b>HTML</b> continues to grow with new versions that add better support for modern features. For example, newer versions of HTML support audio, video, and forms that are easier to style and manage. It also allows developers to describe the meaning of content using special elements for navigation, articles, headers, and footers. This makes web pages not only easier to build but also easier for search engines and screen readers to understand. With good use of HTML, a website becomes more organized, accessible, and readable.</p>

            <div class="info-box" id="css">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is used to style and visually enhance HTML content. With CSS, developers can control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of a web page. It allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation, making websites more maintainable and flexible. CSS also supports responsive design, enabling websites to adapt their appearance to different screen sizes and devices.</p>

            <div class="info-box" id="js">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p><b>JavaScript</b> is a powerful scripting language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It can manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user events, validate forms, update content without reloading the page (via AJAX), and much more. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, enabling real-time interactions such as animations, pop-ups, sliders, and complex web applications. It is a crucial part of modern web development alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
