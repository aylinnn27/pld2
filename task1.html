                <h3>What is Flexbox and why it's used?</h3>
                <p>Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model that allows elements within a container to be automatically arranged and aligned efficiently—even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It was designed to improve the flexibility and control of layouts, making it easier to create responsive web designs.</p>

                <h3>Why is Flexbox considered better than traditional float or inline-block layouts?</h3>
                <ul class="pros">
                    <li>Simplified alignment: Flexbox makes it easy to align items both horizontally and vertically without using extra hacks or wrappers.</li>
                    <li>Responsive by default: It adapts to different screen sizes and content changes smoothly.</li>
                    <li>No clearfix needed: Unlike floats, Flexbox doesn’t break the layout and doesn't require clearing.</li>
                    <li>Order control: You can easily rearrange the order of items using just CSS.</li>
                    <li>Better spacing and distribution: Flexbox handles space between items intelligently, allowing even spacing or alignment to the start, end, or center.</li>
